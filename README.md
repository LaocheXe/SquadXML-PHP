# SquadXML-PHP

 Currently this works but shows ever user in the database
 Right now this is connecting to SMF forums database with added colums to the members table (id_arma, and arma_motto) + more but will deal with that once we get it working

 This page will make it into an XML document, the code is some what ugly and there is no updated version of it so I want to do so and bring it in to e107 later as a plugin but for now keeping it simple.




 
 What is the use of this PHP and XML? A game called Arma 3 (even Arma 2) uses a squad XML where the player/user inputs the URL into the game and the game pulls the XML (and checks if the users Arma ID and Arma Name matches in the XML) and gives the Team's tags and logo which shows it in game.
 
 So this file pulls information off the database and displays is as an XML so admins don't have to go in every time there is a new member that joins to put in their arma id and change the name every time they get promoted.
